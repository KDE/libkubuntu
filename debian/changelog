libkubuntu (14.10ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fix comment typo
  * Add additional safeguard logic when writing the the locale env vars
    to prevent people from breaking their system by defining country-language
    combinations we cannot represent on a POSIX level.
    The added logic gets a list of all valid locales by running locale -a
    and then compares the reference locale with the supported ones.
    If no perfect match is found only LANGUAGE is written as bogus values
    have no adverse effect with this variable, the other ones however are
    explicitly excluded. Only if a locale can be verified as supported will
    we write LANG and LC_*.
    LP: #1322968
  * Add new directory kconf_update and a c++ updater
    libkubuntu-force-setlocale-rewrite-14-04 to force a rewrite of setlocale
    iff the file already exists. This ensures that broken setups get fixed
    according to the new write rules outlined above.
  * Update test cases accordingly
  * Build depend on language-pack-en as we need a configured locale en_US for
    the refined tests to pass

libkubuntu (14.04ubuntu4) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Bump standards from 3.9.4. to 3.9.5 to silence lintian.
  * new bool LanguageCollectionPrivate::initalized
    + defaults to false
    + set to the return value of qapt::backend::init
    + presents fatal init error and results in the collection being defunct
    + collection::languages() returns an empty set if the backend could not
      be initalized
    This prevents crashes in l10nevent when either the apt configs or
    the cache is busted.

libkubuntu (14.04ubuntu3) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Instead of manually chopping newlines, use QString::simplified
  * Use correct kde code mapping to resolve prefix packages
  * Add Language::missingPackages to get a list of all missing packages
  * Explicitly define a LanguageCollection destructor to prevent QScopedPointer
    from acting up because LanguageCollectionPrivate is a forward decl.
  * Make LanguageCollection() non-explicit, doesn't add any value.
  * Inject a fake en_US Language instance in the LanguageCollection
    + en_US is now mapped to generic en codes for both our's and Ubuntu's
      general l10n packaging.
    + The point of this is to ensure that for example english documentation
      such as amarok-help-en is installed on en_US systems that would
      otherwise not require any additional packages.
